        Anea's Bio
     </body>
     <ol>

      <p> As you know my name is Anea Maylisa Serrano Vargas. I am the daughter of Carlos Serrano and Tasia Vargas. I have two siblings at the moment, and their names are Analeticia and Carlos. I call my sister Lety for short and my brother Andres because its his middle name. My siblings are my world to me. They are my everything. My dad has a girlfriend who's pregnant so I will have a half sibling being born this summer. His name will be Angel. I am very close to most of my family. Especially on my dads side. My cousins are like my second siblings. My youngest cousin likes me a lot, and when she's scared of something then she trusts me to protect her. Family means a lot to me.<br>

<p> I enjoy dancing, baking, watching netflix, hanging out with my friends, having sleepovers with my cousins, and babysitting. I took dance classes ever since I was 8. Before that I used to take cheerleading. Baking is fun because you get to make things that taste good. Netflix is good for your soul, it has very interesting shows and movies. With my friends im happy and laugh a lot. With my cousins we make funny videos and good memories. I also like babysitting because making a little kid happy and feel safe with you makes you feel like a good person. </p>
